53208.0,Team,[CVS UI] Major vs. minor version names (1GJJA1E),It would be nice to be able to distinguish between major and minor version numbers when displaying the existing project versions. ; I would imagine having a [+] in front of a major version would give me the minor ones available in case I care; like newsgroup browsers which; stack all related frames.; ; NOTES:; ; JEM (9/21/2001 12:06:43 PM); 	By what rules would you distinguish between major and minor segments of the version name?; 	The only obvious convention (using period to distinguish) is invalid since period is not a valid character in project versions.; 	Is underscore generally used to separate these components? I think this depends on usage patterns.; ; PM (9/24/2001 10:35:46 AM); 	When a version name is the prefix of another; then the latter is a minor version of this version name  (e.g. v_128; v_128_01_pm).; ; JEM (9/24/2001 9:36:56 AM); 	Yes; but by the prefix of another do you mean separated by an underscore? Or any prefix at all? The; 	problem with trying to assign meaning to major and minor version numbers is that (1) they are determined; 	by convention and (2) valid version numbers are determined by the adapter; e.g. in CVS you cant have a; 	period in the version number but you can have an underscore; so by convention underscore separates; 	major and minor version numbers. But in another adapter; you may be allowed to use . but NOT _; in that; 	case the convention would be different.; ; 	After we re-engineer our API this may be easier to accomplish.,RESOLVED,WONTFIX
